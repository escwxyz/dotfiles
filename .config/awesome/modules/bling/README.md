a fork of bling aimed at improving some of its layouts

added so far:
- ability to specify master position in mstab layout
  - set `beautiful.mstab_master_position` to `left` or `right`
  - maybe i should make 2 separate layouts for left or right though (following `tile left` and `tile right`'s examples')
- fixed resizing for mstab! :-)

to do list:
- stop mstab from flickering when navigating between slaves
- work on tabbed containers
  - i havent used them in a while but i remember having a really weird time with them
